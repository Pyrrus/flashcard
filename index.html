            <p class="operatorsText">
              Programming languages typically support a set of operators: constructs which behave generally like functions, but which differ syntactically or semantically from usual functions. Common simple examples include arithmetic (addition with +, comparison with >) and logical operations (such as AND or &&). More involved examples include assignment (usually = or :=), field access in a record or object (usually .), and the scope resolution operator (often ::). Languages usually define a set of built-in operators, and in some cases allow user-defined operators.

          <p class="variablesText">
            In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. Typically, a program consists of instruction s that tell the computer what to do and data that the program uses when it is running.

          <p class="vncText">
            In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.

          <p class="functionsText">
            In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value. Most programming languages come with a prewritten set of functions that are kept in a library.

          <p class="methodsText">
            A method (or message) in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with an object. An object is made up of data and behavior, which form the interface that an object presents to the outside world. Data is represented as properties of the object and behavior as methods.

          <p class="argumentsText">
            The term parameter (sometimes called formal parameter) is often used to refer to the variable as found in the function definition, while argument (sometimes called actual parameter) refers to the actual value passed.

          <button type="button" name="button" class="btn" id="parameters">Parameters</button>

          <p class="parametersText">
            In computer programming, a parameter is a special kind of variable, used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine. [a] These pieces of data are called arguments.

          <p class="returnText">
            In computer programming, a return statement causes execution to leave the current subroutine and resume at the point in the code immediately after where the subroutine was called, known as its return address.

          <button type="button" name="button" class="btn" id="cm">Chaining methods</button>

          <p class="cmText">
            Method chaining, also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results.

          <button type="button" name="button" class="btn" id="strings">Strings</button>

          <p class="stringsText">
            In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation).

        <div class="col-md-3">
          <button type="button" name="button" class="btn" id="booleans">Booleans</button>

          <p class="boolText">
            Developed by the English mathematician and computer pioneer George Boole, a Boolean or bool consists of operators such as AND, OR, NOT, and XOR. Booleans are often used in programming and in Internet search engines. Boolean expressions are expressions that result in the value of either TRUE or FALSE.

      <div class="row">

          <button type="button" name="button" class="btn" id="undefined">Undefined</button>

          <p class="undefText">
            In computing (particularly, in programming), undefined value is a condition where an expression does not have a correct value, although it is syntactically correct. An undefined value must not be confused with empty string, boolean "false" or other "empty" (but defined) values. Depending on circumstances, evaluation to an undefined value may lead to exception or undefined behaviour, but in some programming languages undefined values can occur during a normal, predictable course of program execution.

        <div class="col-md-3">
          <button type="button" name="button" class="btn" id="nan">NaN</button>

          <p class="nanText">
            NaN means "Not a Number" and is the result of undefined operations on floating point numbers like for example dividing zero by zero. (Note that while dividing a non-zero number by zero is also usually undefined in mathematics, it does not result in NaN but in positive or negative infinity)

        <div class="col-md-3">
          <button type="button" name="button" class="btn" id="escape">Escape</button>

          <p class="escapeText">
            An escape sequence is a series of characters used to change the state of computers and their attached peripheral devices. These are also known as control sequences, reflecting their use in device control. Some control sequences are special characters that always have the same meaning. Escape sequences use an escape character to change the meaning of the characters which follow it, meaning that the characters can be interpreted as a command to be executed rather than as data.

          <p class="commentsText">
            In computer programming, a comment is a programmer-readable annotation in the source code of a computer program. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters.

          <p class="jqueryText">
            jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today, with installation on 65% of the top 10 million highest-trafficked sites on the Web. jQuery is free, open-source software licensed under the MIT License.

          <p class="attributesText">
            In computing, an attribute is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. It may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance of such. For clarity, attributes should more correctly be considered metadata.
